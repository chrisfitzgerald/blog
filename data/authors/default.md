Hey there, I'm an Application Specialist at a big data SaaS company based in Chicago. I work remotely across the lake in Michigan and love spending time with my family - I'm a proud husband and dad! In my free time, you'll often find me tinkering with and watching tutorials on the latest advancements in AI, big data, and other tech-related topics. I'm always looking for new ways to expand my technical knowledge and stay on top of industry trends. When not at the desk, I enjoy running, getting outside with the kiddos, and playing video games. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you'd like to collaborate.
